# Some technicalities
I used the NetBeans IDE to develop this project. It seemed that the TA preferred Eclipse, but I had great difficulty having Eclipse to work compared to
NetBeans since I am much more familar with NetBeans. The GUI is more or less the one provided by the TA except that I added a dropdown menu for the
Sales and Summary listing searchs, made bidItem.jsp work and have a bidder after placing a bid to be redirected there, and some other minor changes
to some of the tables. Other than that, the GUI is the same as the one the TA initially handed out. Another small detail was that I was unable to create
a dump of the database with the MySQL server I was using to develop the project since the cloud-based MySQL server I was using is version 5
while I am using locally the dump tool from version 8. To get around this, I created a dump file from my local instance of MySQL.
